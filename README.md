## My Role


### User Stories

- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.

### Key Features

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
